## Minimum Requirements

Pattern compilation is done with [Node](https://nodejs.org), using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation will include `npm`. The version of Node that maintainers develop against is documented [here](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/dev/.nvmrc). Pattern Lab comes with its own local development webserver.

Because Pattern Lab's output consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript there are **no requirements** for hosting your Pattern Lab site. Simply upload the `./public/` directory to your host and you should be good to go.

<strong>The PHP version of Pattern Lab is being deprecated in favor of a new unified Pattern Lab core. <a href='./php/requirements'>The PHP docs for this topic can be viewed here.</a></strong>
