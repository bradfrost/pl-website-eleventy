If you're on Windows you'll need to use the command line options when using the PHP version of Pattern Lab. To access the command prompt you can [follow the directions from Microsoft](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window).

After getting to the command prompt type the following to make sure you have PHP installed:

```
php -v
```

If you get an error you may need to [update your path variable so Windows can find PHP](http://willj.co/2012/10/run-wamp-php-windows-7-command-line/).
