## Step 1: Install requirements

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed before setting up Pattern Lab.

## Step 2: Run the create Pattern Lab command

Open [the command line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) and run the following command:

```
npm create pattern-lab
```

This will bring up an installation menu that presents the following steps:

## Step 3: Choose a directory

**`Please specify a directory for your Pattern Lab project.`** Choose the directory where you want to install Pattern Lab. The default location is the current directory.

## Step 4: Choose templating language

**`What templating language do you want to use with Pattern Lab?`** Choose the Pattern Lab edition that you want to install. The options are:

!["choose edition"](/images/3chooseedition.png)

- `edition-node (handlebars engine)`
- `edition-node-gulp (legacy)`

## Step 5: Choose initial patterns

`What initial patterns do you want included in your project?` - Choose the <a href="/docs/advanced-starterkits.html">Starterkit</a> you want to begin your project with. Starterkits define the initial components and assets that are included in the initial project. Start from scratch, start from a full demo, or a lightweight boilerplate.

4. `Are you happy with your choices? (Hit enter for YES)?` - Confirm your choices, and when done the Pattern Lab installation will begin.

With those questions answered, Pattern Lab will begin installing. Once the installation is complete, you're ready to <a href="/docs/generating-pattern-lab.html">generate Pattern Lab for the first time.</a>
