## Step 1: Install Requirements

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed before setting up Pattern Lab.

## Step 2: Install Pattern Lab

Open [the command line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) and run the following command:

```
npm create pattern-lab
```

!["npm create pattern lab"](/images/1createpl.png)

This will bring up an installation menu that presents the following steps:

1. `Please specify a directory for your Pattern Lab project.` - Choose the directory where you want to install Pattern Lab. The default location is the current directory.

!["choose directory"](/images/2choosedirectory.png)

2. `Which edition do you want to use (defaults to edition-node)?` - Choose the Pattern Lab edition that you want to install. The options are:

!["choose edition"](/images/3chooseedition.png)

- `edition-node (handlebars engine)`
- `edition-node-gulp (legacy)`

3. `Which starterkit do you want to use?` - Choose the <a href="/docs/advanced-starterkits.html">Starterkit</a> you want to begin your project with. Starterkits define the initial components and assets that are included in the initial project. Start from scratch, start from a full demo, or a lightweight boilerplate.

4. `Are you happy with your choices? (Hit enter for YES)?` - Confirm your choices, and when done the Pattern Lab installation will begin.

With those questions answered, Pattern Lab will begin installing. Once the installation is complete, you're ready to <a href="/docs/generating-pattern-lab.html">generate Pattern Lab for the first time.</a>
