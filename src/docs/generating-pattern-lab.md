Running Pattern Lab for the first time will vary depending on which version was [installed](/docs/installation.html).

## edition-node

If you installed [edition-node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node), run the following command to serve Pattern Lab and watch for changes:

```
npm run pl:serve
```

## edition-node-gulp (legacy)

If you installed Pattern Lab [edition-node-gulp](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp), run the following command to serve Pattern Lab and watch for changes:

```
gulp patternlab:serve
```

## Pattern Lab is now running: now what?

Your Pattern Lab should now be populated and [available for viewing](/docs/viewing-patterns.html#node) and you can [make changes to your patterns](/docs/editing-source-files.html).
